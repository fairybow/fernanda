## :tea: **hi**

Fernanda is a plain text editor for drafting long-form fiction. (At least, that's the plan.)

This is a personal project, a work-in-progress, and I am *so* not a programmer. Still, I decided I didn't like existing novel-writing software very much, and I wanted to make something all my own. My hope is that it's easy to use, lightly-customizable, and distraction-free, for faster, more peaceful drafting.

Fernanda's look was inspired by the good, quiet feeling of using [WordStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar) on [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) to draft, and its interface was inspired by [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) (goodnight :two_hearts:).

Fernanda got its name because I just really like the name a lot. But, as it turns out, Fernanda means an ["adventurous, bold journey"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernanda) (the kind one might be *called* to, say), and I think that's neat <img src="fernanda/res/icons/fernanda.ico" alt="Colorful conch shell icon." width="16px"/>.

## :compass: **roadmap**

An early Windows release is available for testing [here](https://github.com/fairybow/fernanda/releases), and an early Arch Linux package is also available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fernanda) (courtesy of [@philipplenk](https://github.com/philipplenk)).

More to come.

## :honeybee: **built with**

Fernanda is built with:
- C++
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
- and [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

Fernanda's `.story` files rely on:
- Bit7z by [@rikyoz](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z)
- and, thus, 7-zip by [Igor Pavlov](https://www.7-zip.org/)

Among the fonts used are:

- Cascadia Mono by [@microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
- Cozette :purple_heart: by [@slavfox](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette)
- Day Roman by Apostrophic Labs
- Dot Matrix by [Dionaea Fonts](https://dionaea.com/information/fonts.php)
- Fixedsys Excelsior (with programming ligatures) by [@kika](https://github.com/kika/fixedsys)
- Iosevka by [@be5invis](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
- More Perfect DOS VGA by [@L∆MEUR](https://laemeur.sdf.org/fonts/)
- Nouveau IBM by Arto Hatanp‰‰
- and OpenDyslexic by [Abbie Gonzalez](https://opendyslexic.org/)

## :smiley_cat: **thanks**

A major thanks to [@philipplenk](https://codemetas.de/) for their teaching and interest and support in helping me work toward a small dream like this (and for helping me make Fernanda available for [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fernanda)).

A major thanks, too, to [@rikyoz](https://github.com/rikyoz/) for their tireless work on the very amazing [bit7z library](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z).
