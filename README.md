## :wave: **hi**

Fernanda is for drafting long-form fiction. (At least, that's the plan.)

## **so?**

Fernanda is a personal project, a work-in-progress, and I am (clearly) not a programmer.

I decided I didn't like existing novel-writing software very much, and I wanted something that would be easy to use, lightly-customizable, and distraction-free, for faster, more peaceful drafting.

I like the idea of binder-style writing software, but I feel like a lot of writing programs like that, with features like corkboards or mindmaps or timelines, really just end up keeping me from actually drafting. Plus, they usually tend to take a kind of ownership over my files and drafts. So, I wanted something that didn't do any of those things. I want to draft in Fernanda, and then I want to be able to take that plain-text draft and move it easily to whatever other place or program I want or need to.
