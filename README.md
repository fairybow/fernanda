## :wave: **hi**

Fernanda is for drafting long-form fiction. (At least, that's the plan.)

**so**

Fernanda is a personal project, a work-in-progress, and I am (clearly) not a programmer.

I decided I didn't like existing novel-writing software very much, and I wanted something that would be easy to use, lightly-customizable, and distraction-free, for faster, more peaceful drafting.

More to come.
